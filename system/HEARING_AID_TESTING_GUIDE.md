# Hearing Aid Test Results Persistence Testing Guide

## 🎯 **Problem Fixed**
Hearing aid test results were disappearing after logging out of the staff account because they were only stored in the session.

## ✅ **Solution Implemented**
- Hearing aid test results are now saved to the database (`tbl_test` table)
- Results persist after logout and can be retrieved from the database
- Backward compatibility maintained with existing session-based data

## 🧪 **Testing Steps**

### **Step 1: Create a Hearing Aid Test**
1. **Login** to the staff account
2. **Navigate** to "New Appointment" page
3. **Click** the "Test" button for any appointment
4. **Select** "Hearing Aid Fitting" from the dropdown
5. **Fill out** the hearing aid test form:
   - Brand: Select any brand (e.g., Unitron)
   - Model: Select any model (e.g., TMAXX600 Chargable)
   - Ear Side: Select Left, Right, or Both
   - Date Issued: Select today's date
6. **Click** "Save Test Results"

### **Step 2: Verify Immediate Display**
1. **Navigate** to "Patient Record" page
2. **Click** on the patient you just tested
3. **Scroll** to the "Test Results" section
4. **Verify** that "Hearing Aid Fitting Results" appears with:
   - Brand
   - Model
   - Ear Side
   - Date Issued

### **Step 3: Test Persistence After Logout**
1. **Log out** of the staff account
2. **Log back in** to the staff account
3. **Navigate** to "Patient Record" page
4. **Click** on the same patient
5. **Scroll** to the "Test Results" section
6. **Verify** that the hearing aid test results are still there

### **Step 4: Test Admin Interface**
1. **Login** to the admin account
2. **Navigate** to "Patient Record" page
3. **Click** on the same patient
4. **Scroll** to the "Test Results" section
5. **Verify** that the hearing aid test results are visible

## 🔍 **Expected Results**

### ✅ **Success Indicators**
- Hearing aid test form saves successfully
- Test results appear immediately in patient record
- Test results persist after logout/login
- Test results visible in both staff and admin interfaces
- No error messages in browser console or Laravel logs

### ❌ **Failure Indicators**
- Test form submission fails
- Test results don't appear immediately
- Test results disappear after logout
- Error messages in browser or logs
- Database connection issues

## 🛠️ **Technical Details**

### **Database Storage**
- **Table**: `tbl_test`
- **Test Type**: "Hearing Aid Fitting"
- **Payload**: JSON containing all test data
- **Patient ID**: Links to patient record

### **File Changes Made**
1. `app/Http/Controllers/HearingAidSessionController.php`
   - Added database saving to `store()` and `storeAndRedirect()` methods
   - Added error handling for database operations

2. `app/Http/Controllers/StaffPatientRecordController.php`
   - Added "Hearing Aid Fitting" to `reverseMap` for database loading

3. `app/Http/Controllers/AdminPatientRecordController.php`
   - Added "Hearing Aid Fitting" to `reverseMap` for database loading

4. `resources/views/results/hearing-aid-results.blade.php`
   - Restored hearing aid results display template
   - Added backward compatibility for date fields

## 🚨 **Troubleshooting**

### **If Test Results Don't Persist**
1. Check Laravel logs: `storage/logs/laravel.log`
2. Verify database connection
3. Check if `tbl_test` table exists
4. Verify user has proper permissions

### **If Test Form Doesn't Save**
1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Verify CSRF token is present
3. Check Laravel validation errors
4. Verify route is accessible

### **If Results Don't Display**
1. Check if patient ID matches between session and database
2. Verify `reverseMap` includes "Hearing Aid Fitting"
3. Check if `hearingAidResults` variable is passed to view
4. Verify template syntax

## 📊 **Database Verification**

To manually verify database storage:

```sql
SELECT * FROM tbl_test WHERE test_type = 'Hearing Aid Fitting' ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

This should show hearing aid test records with:
- `patient_id`: The patient's ID
- `test_type`: "Hearing Aid Fitting"
- `test_payload`: JSON containing test data
- `test_date`: Date of the test

## 🎉 **Success Confirmation**

The fix is working correctly if:
1. ✅ Hearing aid tests can be created
2. ✅ Results display immediately
3. ✅ Results persist after logout
4. ✅ Results visible in both staff and admin interfaces
5. ✅ No errors in logs or console

**The hearing aid test results will now persist permanently and will not disappear when you log out of the staff account.**
